      <h1>Rules for Writing Haiku</h1>

      <p>
        While some forms of poetry have free rein with regard to their subject
        or number of lines and syllables, the haiku was established in Japan as
        far back as the 9th century with a specific structure, style, and
        philosophy. Many poets still write in the original 5-7-5 syllable
        pattern and follow the traditional rules for writing haiku.
      </p>

      <h2>Style of Haiku Poetry</h2>

      <p>
        What is a haiku? It is a three-line, beautifully descriptive, form of
        poetry, intended to be read in one breath. If read in Japanese, most
        traditional haiku would have five syllables, or sounds, in the first
        line, seven in the second, and five in the last. The Academy of American
        Poets asserts, "As the form evolved, many of these rules - including the
        5-7-5 practice - have routinely been broken. However, the philosophy of
        haiku has been preserved: the focus on a brief moment in time; a use of
        provocative, colorful images; an ability to be read in one breath; and a
        sense of sudden enlightenment and illumination."
      </p>

      <h2>Traditional Haiku Structure</h2>

      <h3>
        The structure of a traditional haiku is always the same, including the
        following features:
      </h3>

      <ol>
        <li>1. There are only three lines, totaling 17 syllables.</li>
        <li>2. The first line is 5 syllables.</li>
        <li>3. The second line is 7 syllables.</li>
        <li>4. The third line is 5 syllables like the first.</li>
        <li>
          5. Punctuation and capitalization are up to the poet, and need not
          follow the rigid rules used in structuring sentences.
        </li>
        <li>
          6. A haiku does not have to rhyme, in fact usually it does not rhyme
          at all.
        </li>
        <li>7. It can include the repetition of words or sounds</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Steps for Writing a Haiku</h2>

      <h3>
        Even though there are specific rules for writing a traditional haiku,
        the process can still be fun and rewarding. And remember that a modern
        haiku can be more freeform.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        If you are wondering how to write a haiku for the first time, consider
        the following steps:
      </h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Begin by reading examples of haiku - there are some below - to help
          you get inspired about the subjects and construction of haiku. A haiku
          is a beautiful form of poetry, so take time to appreciate it before
          you begin writing it. You can find more examples of haiku poems on
          YourDictionary or in your local library.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a list of possible subjects that you might write about,
          considering various aspects of nature that inspire you. Consider
          traditional subjects like animals, nature, and seasons, or something
          completely different. Even the smallest details can make for great
          haiku.
        </li>
        <li>
          After you choose a subject, you may want to look at a few pictures of
          it, or go outside and admire it. Like all of the great poets before
          you, some of the greatest inspiration comes from simply admiring
          nature and the world around them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a list of words that relate to the subject you have chosen. Be as
          descriptive as possible. Think about feelings and emotions too.
        </li>
        <li>
          The last line is usually used to make an observation about your
          subject. It can be fun to add a surprise here. Looking through the
          list you wrote, can you create an unexpected relationship between the
          first two lines and the third?
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide if you want to write using the 5-7-5 rule or branch outside the
          limits of this pattern. (If you have trouble determining the syllables
          in a word because you are not sure how to pronounce it, you can look
          up the word here on YourDictionary for a count of the syllables.)
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Examples of Traditional Haiku</h2>

      <h3>
        The most famed traditional Japanese poets include Matsuo Basho, Yosa
        Buson, Kobayashi Issa, and Masoaka Shiki. They are known as "the Great
        Four" and their work is still the model for traditional haiku writing
        today.
      </h3>
      <p>
        An old silent pond, A frog jumps into the pond, splash! Silence again.
        On a withered branch A crow has alighted: Nightfall in autumn. - Matsuo
        Basho
      </p>
      <h3>
        The traditional form of haiku has also been embraced by English-speaking
        poets. Here are two examples by Kelly Roper from our sister site
        LoveToKnow.com, both with a focus on nature.
      </h3>

      <p>
        The season gives way. Winter lays down her mantle, As spring bursts to
        life Waiting in the marsh, The heron stands silently, Fish sense death
        is near. - Kelly Roper
