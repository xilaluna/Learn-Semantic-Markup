      <p>
        (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>) is the standard
        markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">(CSS)</abbr>
        and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the
        World Wide Web.[4]
      </p>

      <p>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
        storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
        describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
        included cues for the appearance of the document.
